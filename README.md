This will convert a PNG into 1 pixel snow_l decals that can be pasted into Lönn.

Run the script in the same directory as your PNG, named "input.png", then copy all text from "decalout.txt" and paste into Lönn. Note that decalout.txt will be overwritten each time you run the script

By default, this will generate BG decals. If you want FG, just set line 3 to False

If you don't have the Pillow library, just enter `pip install Pillow` into the terminal
